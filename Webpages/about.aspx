        It's HOT outside and this item is Temperature Sensitive, which means that it requires special packaging to guarantee it arrives to you in good condition. When you order this product we add ice & insulation packaging to your order (once per order). 
        If you remove it at checkout we cannot guarantee your product will arrive safely.
